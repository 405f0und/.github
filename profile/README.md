## Welcome to the 405F0UND Team Github Organization!

This Organization is for team 405Found's final group project for class ops-301d8 in the IT Ops/Cybersecurity program at Code Fellows. Firstly, there is an overview of the project scenario and summary of the problem domain. Project documentation consists of three different repositories. 
   - Documentation: Contains all the documentation that is part of this project. It includes topologies, flowcharts and standard operating procedures that are part of our solution for the project client.
   - Presentations: Contains a copy of the slide deck we used to to present our project in a .pdf format and a link to the original deck in Google Docs. It also has a copy of the final presentation video.  
   - Scripts: Contains code scripts that we used for this project.

### Scenario & Problem Domain:

This is the scenario and basic direction provided by our instruction team: 

*GreenSpark is a startup that offers a range of energy consulting services to businesses. Their team of experts works with clients to identify areas where energy consumption can be reduced and develops customized solutions to help them save money and reduce their carbon footprint.

Our team is tasked with updating the core IT infrastructure of a recent client company acquisition. This young, innovative startup aligns well with the mission of the client company; unfortunately, its IT systems are not yet integrated into the corporate domain and cloud infrastructure.

We have have been assigned to prototype the process of integrating these new companies. As part of the solution we will set up a VPC and Windows Server in AWS to represent existing GreenSpark infrastructure, then practice the process of adding and organizing the new employees in Active Directory, securely connecting the acquisition's office network to the VPC, connecting local endpoints to the domain, and configuring a captive portal on a local router to authenticate using Active Directory.

The goal here is to demonstrate a repeatable, efficient system for integrating new acquisitions in order to increase efficiency's and reduce resources needed in the future.*
