## Welcome to the 405F0UND Team Github Organization!

This Organization is for team 405Found's final group project for class ops-301d8 in the IT Ops/Cybersecurity program at [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) Firstly, there is an overview of the project scenario and summary of the problem domain. After that, our team members are listed with links to their individual [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/?original_referer=) profiles and [GitHub](https://github.com) repositories. Next is a link to the team's project management board in [Trello](https://trello.com), followed by the presentation links. Finally. there are links to our project's three three repositories: 
- **Documentations:** Contains all the documentation that is part of this project, including topograpies, flowcharts ann the standard operating procedures that we wrote as part of the project client's solutions. 
- **Presentation:** Contains a .pdf copy of the slide deck we used to present our solutions and a link to the original document in Google Docs
- **Scripts:** presentations repository contains a pdf of our slideshow as well as a link to the slideshow on GoogleDocs. The video of our presentation will be added to that repository once it is available.

### Scenario & Problem Domain:

Below, in italics, is the scenario and basic direction provided by our instructional team: 

*GreenSpark is a startup that offers a range of energy consulting services to businesses. Their team of experts works with clients to identify areas where energy consumption can be reduced and develops customized solutions to help them save money and reduce their carbon footprint.*

*Our team is tasked with updating the core IT infrastructure of a recent client company acquisition. This young, innovative startup aligns well with the mission of the client company; unfortunately, its IT systems are not yet integrated into the corporate domain and cloud infrastructure.*

*We have have been assigned to prototype the process of integrating these new companies. As part of the solution we will set up a VPC and Windows Server in AWS to represent existing GreenSpark infrastructure, then practice the process of adding and organizing the new employees in Active Directory, securely connecting the acquisition's office network to the VPC, connecting local endpoints to the domain, and configuring a captive portal on a local router to authenticate using Active Directory.*

*The goal here is to demonstrate a repeatable, efficient system for integrating new acquisitions in order to increase efficiency's and reduce resources needed in the future.*

As a team, we identified the following challenges within the problem domain for IT:
- Plans to acquire a new company with further plans to make additional acquisitions in the near future. This requires solutions that are both efficient and recylable.
- Quickly and efficiently incorporate employees from new subsidiary companies into the existing IT governance (ITG) framework to address authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA). 
- Securely joining the IT networks that newly acquired companies have in place to the existing corporate domain and cloud-based network resources via virtual private network (VPN). 

The resources contained within the links below demonstrate the solutions we came up with to address these problems. 

Thanks for visiting our page and we hope browsing through our project files.
