### Scenario & Problem Domain:

GreenSpark is a startup that offers a range of energy consulting services to businesses. Their team of experts works with clients to identify areas where energy consumption can be reduced and develops customized solutions to help them save money and reduce their carbon footprint.

Our team is tasked with updating the core IT infrastructure of a recent client company acquisition. This young, innovative startup aligns well with the mission of the client company; unfortunately, its IT systems are not yet integrated into the corporate domain and cloud infrastructure.

We have have been assigned to prototype the process of integrating these new companies. As part of the solution we will set up a VPC and Windows Server in AWS to represent existing GreenSpark infrastructure, then practice the process of adding and organizing the new employees in Active Directory, securely connecting the acquisition's office network to the VPC, connecting local endpoints to the domain, and configuring a captive portal on a local router to authenticate using Active Directory.

The goal here is to demonstrate a repeatable, efficient system for integrating new acquisitions in order to increase efficiency's and reduce resources needed in the future.
